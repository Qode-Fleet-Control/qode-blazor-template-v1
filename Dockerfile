# Built by .github/workflows/deploy.yml and pushed to Artifact Registry.
#
# The standard two-stage .NET image, as Microsoft's container docs teach it: restore and
# publish on the SDK image, run on the slimmer ASP.NET runtime image.
#   - the csproj is copied and restored first, so the package layer is cached until the
#     project's dependencies change;
#   - Program.cs reads PORT at RUNTIME and listens on 0.0.0.0:$PORT (compose sets it);
#   - runs as the image's built-in non-root `app` user ($APP_UID).
